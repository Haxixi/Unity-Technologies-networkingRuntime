The Unity Networking extension DLL is the open source component of the Unity Multiplayer Networking system. In this DLL we have the whole networking system except the NetworkTransport related APIs and classes. This is all the high level classes and components which make up the user friendly system of creating multiplayer games. This document details how you can compile your own version of the Networking extension DLL and use that in your games and applications.

### What license is the Networking extension DLL shipped under? ###
The Networking extension DLL is released under an MIT/X11 license; see the LICENSE file.

This means that you pretty much can customize and embed it in any software under any license without any other constraints than preserving the copyright and license information while adding your own copyright and license information.

You can keep the source to yourself or share your customized version under the same MIT license or a compatible license.

If you want to contribute patches back, please keep it under the unmodified MIT license so it can be integrated in future versions and shared under the same license.

### How do I get started? ###
* Clone this repository onto a location on your computer.
* Configure your IDE for the Unity coding standard, look in the .editorconfig file for more information
* Open the project in Visual Studio or MonoDevelop
    * If you are using MonoDevelop
        * Ensure you enable XBuild (Preferences -> Projects -> Build ->"Compile projects using MSBuild/XBuild")
        * You may need to restart MonoDevelop
    * Build the solution

* A folder will be created in the root directory called "Output", the generated dll's will output here in the correct folder structure
    * Windows: Copy the contents of Output folder to: `Data\UnityExtensions\Unity\Networking\{UNITY_VERSION}`
    * OSX: Copy the contents of Output folder to: `Unity.app/Contents/UnityExtensions/Unity/Networking/{UNITY_VERSION}`

* If you want the dll's to copy automatically on build
    * For each visual studio project file
        * Open the file in a text editor
        * Locate the section: <Target Name="AfterBuild">
        * Follow the instructions in the comments

### Will you be taking pull requests? ###
We'll consider all incoming pull requests that we get. It's likely we'll take bug fixes this way but anything else will be handled on a case by case basis. Changes will not be applied directly to this repository but to the mainline Unity repository and will then appear here when the code is released in a new Unity version.
